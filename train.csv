" 'Some of these risks are addressed briefly below.',",N,0
" 'Potential investors should possess experience of invest-ing in instruments that are employed within the scope of the proposed investment policy.',",N,0
" 'Inves-tors should also have a clear picture of the risks involved in investing in the units and should not make a decision to invest until they have fully consulted their legal, tax and financial advisors, auditors or other advisors about (i) the suitability of investing in the units, taking into account their personal financial and tax situation and other cir-cumstances, (ii) the information contained in this sales prospectus, and (iii) the fund™s investment policy.It must be noted that investments made by a fund also contain risks in addition to the opportunities for price increases.',",N,0
" 'The fund™s units are securities, the value of which is determined by the price fluctuations of the assets contained in the fund.',",N,0
" 'Accordingly, the value of the units may rise or fall in compari-son with the purchase price.',",N,0
" 'No assurance can therefore be given that the investment objectives will be achieved.Market riskThe price or market performance of financial products depends, in particular, on the perfor-mance of the capital markets, which in turn are affected by the overall economic situation and the general economic and political framework in individual countries.',",N,0
" 'Irrational factors such as sentiment, opinions and rumors have an effect on general price performance, particularly on an exchange.Credit riskThe credit quality (ability and willingness to pay) of the issuer of a security or money market instrument held directly or indirectly by the fund may subsequently decline.',",N,0
" 'This usually leads to price drops in the individual security in excess of the usual market fluctuations.Country or transfer riskA country risk exists when a foreign borrower, despite ability to pay, cannot make payments at all, or not on time, because of the inability or unwillingness of its country of domicile to execute transfers.',",N,0
" 'This means that, for example, payments to which the fund is entitled may not occur, or be in a currency that is no longer convertible due to restrictions on currency exchange.Settlement riskEspecially when investing in unlisted securities, there is a risk that settlement via a transfer sys-tem is not executed as expected because a pay-ment or delivery did not take place in time or as agreed.Legal and tax riskThe legal and tax treatment of funds may change in ways that cannot be predicted or influenced.',",N,0
" 'In the case of a correction with tax consequences that are essentially unfavorable for the investor, changes to the fund™s taxation bases for preceding fiscal years made because these bases are found to be incorrect can result in the investor having to bear the tax burden resulting from the correction for preceding fis-cal years, even though he may not have held an investment in the investment fund at the time.',",N,0
" 'Conversely, the investor may fail to benefit from an essentially favorable correction for the cur-rent or preceding fiscal years during which he held an investment in the investment fund if the units are redeemed or sold before the correction takes place.In addition, a correction of tax data can result in a situation where taxable income or tax benefits are actually assessed for tax in a different assessment period to the applicable one and that this has a negative effect for the individual investor.Currency exposureTo the extent the fund invests in assets denomi-nated in currencies other than the fund currency, the fund will receive income, repayments and proceeds from such investments in the respec-4 tive currency.',",N,0
" 'If the value of these currencies falls in relation to the fund currency, the value of the fund™s assets is reduced.',",N,0
" 'Custody riskThe custody risk describes the risk resulting from the basic possibility that, in the event of insolvency, violation of due diligence or improper conduct on the part of the Depositary or any sub-depositary, the fund may, in whole or in part and to its detriment, be deprived of access to the investments held in custody.Company-specific riskThe price performance of the securities and money market instruments held directly or indi-rectly by the fund is also dependent on compa-ny-specific factors, for example on the business situation of the issuer.',",N,0
" 'If the company-specific factors deteriorate, the market value of the indi-vidual security may significantly and persistently decline, even if the market is performing strongly in general.Concentration riskAdditional risks may arise from a concentration of investments in particular assets or markets.',",N,0
" 'The fund™s net assets then become particularly heavily dependent on the performance of these assets or markets.Risk of changes in interest ratesInvestors should be aware that investing in units may involve interest rate risks.',",N,0
" 'These risks may occur in the event of interest rate fluctuations in the denomination currency of the securities or the fund.Political risk/Regulatory risk The fund may invest abroad.',",N,0
" 'This involves the risk of detrimental international political develop-ments, changes in government policy, changes in taxation and other changes in the legal status.Inflation riskAll assets are subject to a risk of devaluation through inflation.Key individual riskThe exceptionally positive performance of certain funds during a particular period is also attribut-able to the abilities of the individuals acting on behalf of such funds, and therefore to the correct decisions made by their respective fund manage-ment.',",N,0
" 'Fund management personnel can change, however.',",N,0
" 'New decision-makers might not be as successful.Change in the investment policyThe risk associated with the fund may change in terms of content due to a change in the invest-ment policy within the range of investments per-mitted for the fund.Changes to the management regulations; liquidation or mergerIn the management regulations for the fund, the Management Company reserves the right to change the management regulations.',",N,0
" 'In addition, the Management Company may, in accordance with the provisions of the management regula-tions, liquidate the fund entirely or merge it with another fund.',",N,0
" 'For the investor, this entails the risk that the holding period planned by the him will not be realized.Credit riskBonds or debt instruments involve a credit risk with regard to the issuers, for which the issuer™s credit rating can be used as a benchmark.',",N,0
" 'Bonds or debt instruments floated by issuers with a lower rating are generally viewed as securities with a higher credit risk and greater risk of default on the part of the issuer than those instruments that are floated by issuers with a better rating.',",N,0
" 'If an issuer of bonds or debt instruments runs into financial or economic difficulties, this can affect the value of the bonds or debt instruments (this value could drop to zero) and the payments made on the basis of these bonds or debt instruments (these payments could drop to zero).',",N,0
" 'In addition, some bonds or debt instruments are catego-rized as subordinated in the financial structure of an issuer.',",N,0
" 'This can result in heavy losses in the event of financial difficulties.',",N,0
" 'At the same time, the probability that the issuer fulfills these obli-gations is lower than with other bonds or debt instruments.',",N,0
" 'This, in turn, results in a high price volatility for these instruments.Risk of defaultIn addition to the general trends on capital mar-kets, the particular performance of each individ-ual issuer also affects the price of an investment.',",N,0
" 'The risk of a decline in the assets of issuers, for example, cannot be eliminated even by the most careful selection of the securities.',",N,0
" 'Risks associated with derivatives transactionsBuying and selling options, as well as the conclu-sion of futures contracts or swaps, involves the following risks: ŒPrice changes in the underlying can cause a decrease in the value of the option or futures contract, and even result in a total loss.',",N,0
" 'Changes in the value of the asset underlying a swap can also result in losses for the fund assets.',",N,0
" 'ŒAny necessary back-to-back transactions (clos-ing of position) incur costs.',",N,0
" 'ŒThe leverage effect of options may alter the value of the fund™s assets more strongly than the direct purchase of underlyings would.',",N,0
" 'ŒThe purchase of options entails the risk that the options are not exercised because the prices of the underlying assets do not change as expected, meaning that the fund loses the option premium it paid.',",N,0
" 'If options are sold, there is the risk that the fund may be obliged to buy assets at a price that is higher than the current market price, or obliged to deliver assets at a price which is lower than the cur-rent market price.',",N,0
" 'In that case, the fund will incur a loss amounting to the price difference minus the option premium collected.',",N,0
" 'ŒFutures contracts also entail the risk that the fund assets may make losses due to market prices not having developed as expected at maturity.Risk connected to the acquisition of units of investment fundsWhen investing in units of target funds, it must be taken into consideration that the fund man-agers of the individual target funds act inde-pendently of one another and that therefore multiple target funds may follow investment strategies which are identical or contrary to one another.',",N,0
" 'This can result in a cumulative effect of existing risks, and any opportunities might be offset.Risks of investments in contingent convertibles Contingent convertibles (?CoCos?) are hybrid capital instruments.',",N,0
" 'From the issuer™s perspec-tive, as capital buffers they contribute to the fulfillment of certain regulatory capital require-ments.',",N,0
" 'In accordance with the terms of issue, CoCos are either converted into equities or the investment amount is amortized when certain trigger events occur in conjunction with regula-tory capital limits.',",N,0
" 'The conversion event may be triggered by the supervisory authorities, indepen-dent of the trigger events and the control of the issuer if the supervisory authorities call into ques-tion the long-term viability of the issuer or com-panies affiliated with it in the sense of a going concern (conversion/depreciation risk).After a trigger event, the recovery of the capi-tal invested depends mainly on the structure of the CoCo.',",N,0
" 'CoCos can use one of the following three methods to write back up their wholly or partially amortized nominal amount: Conversion into equities, temporary amortization or per-manent amortization.',",N,0
" 'In the case of temporary amortization, amortization is completely discre-tionary, taking into account certain regulatory restrictions.',",N,0
" 'All payments of the coupon after the trigger event are based on the reduced nominal value.',",N,0
" 'Under certain circumstances, a CoCo investor may suffer losses before equity investors and other debt holders in respect of the same issuer.In accordance with minimum requirements established in the EU Capital Requirements Directive IV/Capital Requirements Regulation (CRD IV/CRR), the structure of the conditions of CoCos may be complex and may vary according to issuer or bond.Investing in CoCos is also associated with some additional risks, such as:a) Trigger level riskThe probability and risk of a conversion or write-off are determined by the difference between the trigger and the current capital ratio for the CoCo issuer required under the regulations.5 The mechanical trigger is at least 5.125% of the regulatory capital ratio or more, as defined in the issuing prospectus of the rel-evant CoCo.',",N,0
" 'In particular, if a trigger is set at a high level, CoCo investors can lose invested capital, for example in the event of a depreci-ation of the nominal value or a conversion to equity capital.',",N,0
" 'At sub-fund level this means that the actual risk that a trigger will not be reached is dif-ficult to predict because, for example, the equity capital ratio is only published on a quarterly basis and therefore the actual dif-ference between the trigger and the regu-latory capital ratio is only known at the time of publication.b) Risk of suspension of coupon payment (cou-pon termination risk)The issuer or supervisory authority can sus-pend coupon payments at any time.',",N,0
" 'Any lost coupon payments will not be made up when coupon payments are resumed.',",N,0
" 'CoCo inves-tors risk not receiving all of the coupon pay-ments expected at the point of acquisition.c) Risk of a coupon change (risk that the coupon will be revalued)If the CoCo is not terminated by the CoCo issuer on the defined termination date, the issuer can redefine the issuing conditions.',",N,0
" 'The coupon value may change at the termination date if the issuer does not terminate it.d) Risk due to regulatory requirements (risk of a reversal of the capital structure)A number of minimum requirements for the equity capital of banks were defined in CRD IV.',",N,0
" 'The amount of the capital buffer varies from country-to-country, depending on the regulatory laws that apply to the issuer.The different national requirements at fund level mean that conversion as a result of the discretionary trigger or the suspension of coupon payments can be triggered depend-ing on the regulatory laws that apply to the issuer and that another source of uncertainty exists for the CoCo investor or investor, depending on the national conditions and the independent assessment of the responsible supervisory authority.Furthermore, the assessment of the respon-sible supervisory authority and the relevant specific criteria cannot be conclusively esti-mated in advance.e) Risk that the responsible supervisory author-ity will exercise its termination rights or pre-vent termination (prolongation risk)CoCos are long-term bonds with no fixed term which the issuer has the right to termi-nate at particular dates defined in the issuing prospectus.',",N,0
" 'The decision to exercise termi-nation rights is a discretionary right of the issuer, however it requires the approval of the responsible supervisory authority.',",N,0
" 'The super-visory authority will reach a decision in accor-dance with the applicable regulatory law.The CoCo investor can only sell the CoCo in a secondary market; such a sale is associated with corresponding market and liquidity risks.f) Equity capital and subordination risk (risk of a reversal of the capital structure)When an investment is converted into equi-ties, CoCo investors become shareholders when a trigger is activated.',",N,0
" 'In the event of insolvency, shareholders can only be ser-viced on a subordinate basis, depending on the remaining available assets.',",N,0
" 'Hence, con-version of the CoCo can lead to a complete loss of capital.g) Risk of industry concentrationThe special structure of CoCos means that the uneven distribution of the risks in terms of financial equities can lead to a risk of indus-try concentration.',",N,0
" 'According to legal regula-tions, CoCos are part of the capital structure of financial institutions.h) Liquidity riskCoCos are associated with a liquidity risk in tense market situations.',",N,0
" 'The reason for this is the special investor group and the lower overall volume in the market compared to conventional bonds.i) Income valuation riskBecause the conditions for terminating CoCos are flexible, it is not clear what date is to be used to calculate income.',",N,0
" 'On any termination date there is always a risk that the maturity of the bond will be deferred, so that the income calculation has to be adjusted to the new date, which can result in a change in returns.j) Unknown riskBecause of the innovative nature of the CoCos and the constantly changing regula-tory environment for financial institutions, risks may arise that cannot be foreseen at present.Further information can be found in the state-ment from the European Securities and Mar-kets Authority (ESMA/2014/944) dated July 31, 2014, regarding the potential risk associated with investments in contingent convertible instruments.Liquidity riskLiquidity risks arise when a particular security is difficult to dispose of.',",N,0
" 'In principle, acquisitions for the fund shall only consist of securities that can be sold again at any time.',",N,0
" 'Nevertheless, it may be difficult to sell particular securities at the desired time during certain phases or in partic-ular exchange segments.',",N,0
" 'There is also the risk that securities traded in a rather narrow market segment will be subject to considerable price volatility.',",N,0
" 'Counterparty riskWhen OTC (?Over-the-Counter?) agreements are concluded, the fund may be subjected to risks in relation to the credit rating of its counterparties and their ability to fulfill the conditions of these contracts.',",N,0
" 'The fund may consequently enter into futures transactions, options transactions and swap transactions or use other derivative techniques, such as total return swaps, that will subject the fund to the risk of a counterparty not fulfilling its obligations under a particular contract.In the event that the counterparty becomes bank-rupt or insolvent, the fund may suffer significant losses due to a delay in liquidating positions, including the loss in value of the investments while the fund pursues its rights.',",N,0
" 'Likewise, it is possible that the use of the agreed techniques may be halted, for example due to bankruptcy, illegality or changes to the law in comparison with the laws that applied at the time the agreements were concluded.',",N,0
" 'Funds can also enter into transactions in OTC and interdealer markets, for example.',",N,0
" 'Typically, par-ticipants in these markets are not subject to the same financial supervision as participants in regu-lated markets.',",N,0
" 'A fund that invests in swaps, total return swaps, derivatives, synthetic instruments or other OTC transactions in these markets bears the counterparty credit risk and is also subject to risk of default by the counterparty.',",N,0
" 'These risks can differ significantly from those that apply to transactions on regulated markets, as the latter are secured by guarantees, daily mark-to-market valuation, daily settlement and corresponding segregation and minimum capital requirements.',",N,0
" 'Transactions that are concluded directly between two counterparties do not generally benefit from this protection.',",N,0
" 'The fund is also subject to the risk that the counterparty will not execute the transaction as agreed due to a disagreement regarding the terms of contract (regardless of whether or not this is in good faith) or due to a credit or liquidity problem.',",N,0
" 'This can lead to losses for the respec-tive fund.',",N,0
" 'This counterparty risk increases for contracts with a longer maturity period, as events may preclude agreement, or if the fund has ori-ented its transactions to a single counterparty or to a small group of counterparties.',",N,0
" 'In the event of default by the counterparty, the fund may be subject to adverse market move-ments while replacement transactions are being carried out.',",N,0
" 'The fund can conclude a transaction with any counterparty.',",N,0
" 'It can also conclude an unlimited number of transactions with one coun-terparty.',",N,0
" 'The fact that the fund can conduct trans-actions with any counterparty, the lack of mean-ingful and independent evaluation of the financial characteristics of the counterparty as well as the lack of a regulated market for the conclusion of agreements may increase the loss exposure of the fund.Risks in connection with the use of   securities lending transactions and  repurchase agreementsIf the counterparty of a securities lending trans-action or repurchase agreement defaults, the fund may suffer a loss due to the fact that the income from the sale of the collateral held by the fund in connection with the securities lending transaction or repurchase agreement is less than the securities lent or sold.',",N,0
" 'In addition, the fund 6 may suffer losses due to bankruptcy or due to similar proceedings against the counterparty of the securities lending transaction or repurchase agreement or due to any other type of non-fulfill-ment of the return of the securities, e.g., loss of interest or loss of the respective security as well as default and enforcement costs in relation to the securities lending transaction or repurchase agreement.',",N,0
" 'It is assumed that the use of a pur-chase with a repurchase option or of a reverse repurchase agreement and securities lending agreement does not have any substantial influ-ence on the performance of the fund.',",N,0
" 'However, the use of such instruments can have a signifi-cant effect, either positive or negative, on the net asset value of the fund.Risks associated with receiving collateralThe fund receives for derivatives transactions, securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements.',",N,0
" 'Derivatives, lent securities or secu-rities sold under repurchase agreements can increase in value.',",N,0
" 'The collateral provided may then no longer suffice to cover in full the fund™s right of supply or of return transfer with respect to the counterparty.The fund can invest cash collateral in blocked cash accounts, in government bonds with high credit ratings or in money market funds with a short maturity structure.',",N,0
" 'The credit institution holding the bank balances can fail however.',",N,0
" 'Government bonds and money market funds can perform poorly.',",N,0
" 'At the end of the term, the full amount of the invested collateral may no longer be available, even though it must be returned by the fund in the amount originally granted.',",N,0
