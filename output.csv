21,(A) (i) of the sales prospectus are met.General risk warningsInvesting in the shares of the Investment Com-pany involves risks.,0.0
22,"Risks may include or be associated with equity and bond market risks, interest rate, credit, counterparty default, liquid-ity and counterparty risks, as well as exchange rate, volatility and political risks.",0.0
23,Each of these risks can also occur together with other risks.,0.0
24,Some of these risks are briefly discussed below.,0.0
25,Potential investors should inform themselves about investments and instruments that can be used within the framework of the planned investment policy.,0.0
26,"Investors should also be aware of the risks associated with investing in the shares and should only make an investment decision when they have received comprehen-sive advice from their legal, tax and financial advisors, auditors or other advisors on (i) the suitability of an investment in the shares, taking into account their personal financial and tax situation and other circumstances, (ii) the infor-mation contained in this sales prospectus and (iii) the investment policy of the relevant sub-fund.It should be noted that a sub-fund™s invest-ments also contain risks as well as opportuni-ties for price increases.",0.0
27,The shares of the Investment Company are securities whose value is determined by the price fluctuations of the assets they contain.,0.0
28,"Accordingly, the value of the shares may rise or fall relative to the purchase price.",0.0
29,"Consequently, no assurance can be given that the objectives of the investment policy will be achieved.Market riskThe price or market performance of financial products depends, in particular, on the perfor-mance of the capital markets, which in turn are affected by the overall economic situation and the general economic and political framework in individual countries.",0.0
30,"Irrational factors such as sentiment, opinions and rumors can also have an effect on general price performance, particularly on an exchange.",0.0
31,Creditworthiness riskThe credit quality (ability and willingness to pay) of the issuer of a security or money market instrument held directly or indirectly by the fund may subsequently decline.,1.0
32,"As a rule, this leads to price declines of the respective security that exceed the general market fluctuations.Country or transfer riskA country risk exists when a foreign borrower, despite ability to pay, cannot make payments at all, or not on time, because of the inability or unwillingness of its country of domicile to exe-cute transfers.",0.0
33,"This means that, for example, payments to which the sub-fund is entitled may not occur, or may be in a currency that is no longer convertible due to restrictions on currency exchange.Settlement riskEspecially when investing in unlisted securities, there is a risk that settlement via a transfer system is not executed as expected because a payment or delivery did not take place in time or as agreed.Legal and tax riskThe legal and tax treatment of sub-funds may change in ways that cannot be predicted or influenced.",0.0
34,"In the case of a correction with tax consequences that are essentially unfavorable for the investor, changes to the sub-fund™s taxation bases for preceding fiscal years made because these bases are found to be incorrect can result in the investor having to bear the tax burden resulting from the correction for preced-ing fiscal years, even though he may not have held an investment in the investment fund at the time.",0.0
35,"Conversely, the investor may fail to benefit from an essentially favorable correction for the current or preceding fiscal years during which he held an investment in the investment fund if the shares are redeemed or sold before the correc-tion takes place.In addition, a correction of tax data can result in a situation where taxable income or tax benefits are actually assessed for tax in a different assessment period to the applicable one and that this has a negative effect for the individual investor.Currency riskTo the extent the sub-fund invests in assets denominated in currencies other than the respec-tive sub-fund currency, the sub-fund will receive income, repayments and proceeds from such investments in these other currencies.",0.0
36,"If the value of these currencies falls in relation to the sub-fund currency, the value of the sub-fund is reduced.",0.0
37,"Custody riskCustody risk describes the risk resulting from the basic possibility that in the event of insolvency, violations of due diligence or improper conduct on the part of the Depositary or a sub-depositary, the assets held in custody could be partially or completely withdrawn from access by the sub-fund, to its detriment.Concentration riskAdditional risks may arise from a concentration of investments in particular assets or markets.",0.0
38,"The assets of the Investment Company then become particularly heavily dependent on the performance of these assets or markets.Risk of changes in interest ratesInvestors should be aware that an investment in shares may involve interest rate risks which may arise in the event of fluctuations in the interest rates in the currency applicable to the securities or sub-fund in question.Legal and political risksInvestments for the Investment Company may be undertaken in jurisdictions in which Luxem-bourg law does not apply, or where, in the case of disputes, the place of jurisdiction is outside Luxembourg.",0.0
39,"Any resulting rights and obligations of the Investment Company may differ from those in Luxembourg to the detriment of the Investment Company or the investor.Political or legal developments, including changes to the legal framework in these jurisdictions, may not be detected by the Investment Company, or may be detected too late, or they may lead to restrictions in terms of acquirable assets or assets that have already been acquired.",0.0
40,"These consequences can also arise when the legal framework for the Investment Company and/or the administration of the Investment Company in Luxembourg changes.Operational riskThe Investment Company may be exposed to a risk of loss resulting, for example, from inade-quate internal processes and from human error or system failures at the Investment Company, the Management Company or external third parties.",0.0
41,"These risks may adversely affect the performance of a sub-fund and thus also adversely affect the net asset value per share and the capital invested by the investor.Inflation riskAll assets are subject to a risk of devaluation through inflation.3Key individual riskThe exceptionally positive performance of certain sub-funds during a particular period is also attributable to the abilities of the individuals acting on behalf of such funds, and therefore to the correct decisions made by their respective fund management.",0.0
42,"Fund management personnel can change, however.",0.0
43,New decision-makers might not be as successful.Change in the investment policyThe risk associated with the sub-fund may change in terms of content due to a change in the investment policy within the permissible investment spectrum for the respective sub-fund.Amendment to the sales prospectus; liquidation or mergerThe Investment Company reserves the right to amend the sales prospectus for each sub-fund.,0.0
44,"In addition, it may, in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Investment Company and the sales prospectus, completely liquidate a sub-fund or merge it with another sub-fund.",0.0
45,"For the investor, this entails the risk that the holding period planned by the investor will not be realized.Credit riskBonds or debt securities entail credit risk with respect to the issuer, for which the issuer™s credit rating can be used as a measure.",0.0
46,Bonds or debt instruments issued by issuers with a lower rating are generally considered to be securities with a higher credit risk and a higher probability of default by the issuer than those issued by issuers with a better rating.,0.0
47,"If an issuer of bonds or debt securities encounters financial or eco-nomic difficulties, this may affect the value of the bonds or debt securities (which may fall to zero) and the payments made on these bonds or debt securities (which may fall to zero).",0.0
48,"In addition, some bonds or debt instruments are also classi-fied as subordinated in the financial structure of an issuer.",0.0
49,"In the event of financial difficulties, serious losses can therefore occur.",0.0
50,"At the same time, the probability that the issuer will meet these obligations is lower than for other bonds or debt instruments.",0.0
51,"This in turn leads to high price volatility of these instruments.Risk of defaultIn addition to the general trends on the capital markets, the price of an investment is also affected by the particular developments of the respective issuers.",0.0
52,"The risk of a decline in the assets of issuers cannot be entirely eliminated, for example, even through careful selection of securities.",0.0
53,"Risks associated with derivative transactionsBuying and selling options, as well as the conclu-sion of futures contracts or swaps (including total return swaps), involves the following risks: ŒPrice changes in the underlying can cause a decrease in the value of the option or future, and even result in a total loss.",0.0
54,Changes in the value of the asset underlying a swap or a total return swap can also result in losses for the sub-fund™s assets.,0.0
55,ŒAny necessary back-to-back transactions (closing of position) incur costs that can reduce the value of the sub-fund™s assets.,0.0
56,"ŒThe leverage effect of options, swaps, futures contracts and other derivatives may alter the value of the sub-fund™s assets more strongly than the direct purchase of underly-ings would.",0.0
57,"ŒThe purchase of options entails the risk that the call options are not exercised because the prices of the underlyings do not change as expected, meaning that the sub-fund loses the option premium it paid.",0.0
58,"If options are sold, there is the risk that the sub-fund may be obliged to buy assets at a price that is higher than the current market price, or obliged to deliver assets at a price which is lower than the current market price.",0.0
59,"In that case, the sub-fund suffers a loss amounting to the price difference less the option pre-mium received.",0.0
60,"ŒFutures contracts also entail the risk that the sub-fund™s assets may incur losses due to market prices not having developed as expected at maturity.Risks associated with the acquisition of investment fund unitsWhen investing in units in target funds, it should be borne in mind that the fund managers of the individual target funds act independently of one another, and therefore several target funds can be engaged in similar or mutually opposing investment strategies.",0.0
61,"This can result in a cumu-lative effect of existing risks, and any opportuni-ties might be offset.Risks of investing  in contingent convertibles Contingent convertibles (ﬁCoCosﬂ) are a form of hybrid financial instrument.",0.0
62,"From the perspective of the issuer, they act as a capital buffer and contribute to the fulfillment of certain regulatory capital requirements.",0.0
63,"Under their terms and conditions of issue, CoCos are either converted into shares or their principal amount is written down upon the occurrence of certain trigger events linked to regulatory capital thresholds.",0.0
64,"The conversion event can also be triggered by the supervisory authorities, independently of the trigger events and outside of the control of the issuer, if the supervisory authorities call into question the long-term viability of the issuer, or of companies related to the issuer, as a going concern (conversion/write-down risk).Following a trigger event, the recovery of the capital invested depends essentially on the configuration of the CoCo.",0.0
65,"CoCos can use one of the following three methods to recover their fully or partially written-down nominal value: conver-sion into shares, temporary write-down or permanent write-off.",0.0
66,"In the case of a temporary write-down, the write-down is completely discre-tionary, taking into account certain regulatory restrictions.",0.0
67,Any coupon payments after the trigger event are based on the reduced nominal value.,0.0
68,"A CoCo investor may therefore, under certain circumstances, incur losses ahead of equity investors and other holders of debt instru-ments in respect of the same issuer.In accordance with the minimum requirements set out in the EU Capital Requirements Direc-tive IV / Capital Requirements Regulation (CRD IV/CRR), the configuration of the terms  and conditions of CoCos can be complex and can vary depending on the issuer or the bond.Investment in CoCos is associated with some additional risks, such as:a)   Risk of falling below the specified trigger (trigger level risk)The probability and the risk of a conversion or of a write-down are determined by the difference between the trigger level and the capital ratio of the CoCo issuer currently required for regulatory purposes.The mechanical trigger is at least 5.125% of the regulatory capital ratio or higher, as set out in the issue prospectus of the respective CoCo.",0.0
69,"Espe-cially in the case of a high trigger, CoCo investors may lose the capital invested as, for example, in the case of a write-down of the nominal value or a conversion into equity capital (shares).",0.0
70,"At sub-fund level, this means that the actual risk of falling below the trigger level is difficult to assess in advance because, for example, the capital ratio of the issuer may only be published quarterly and therefore the actual gap between the trigger level and the capital ratio is only known at the time of publication.b)  Risk of suspension of the coupon payment (coupon cancellation risk)The issuer or the supervisory authority can suspend the coupon payments at any time.",0.0
71,Any lost coupon payments are not made up for when coupon payments are resumed.,0.0
72,"For the CoCo investor, there is a risk that not all of the coupon payments expected at the time of acquisition will be received.c)  Risk of a change to the coupon  (coupon resetting risk)If the CoCo is not called by the CoCo issuer on the specified call date, the issuer can redefine the terms and conditions of issue.",0.0
73,"If the issuer does not call the CoCo, the amount of the cou-pon can be changed on the call date.4d)  Risk due to prudential requirements  (risk of a reversal of the capital structure)A number of minimum requirements in relation to the equity capital of banks were defined in CRD IV.",0.0
74,"The amount of the required capital buffer differs from country to country in accordance with the respective valid regulatory law applica-ble to the issuer.At sub-fund level, the different national require-ments have the consequence that the conver-sion as a result of the discretionary trigger or the suspension of the coupon payments can be triggered accordingly depending on the regula-tory law applicable to the issuer and that an additional uncertainty factor exists for the CoCo investor, or the investor, depending on the national conditions and the sole judgment of the respective competent supervisory authority.Moreover, the opinion of the respective compe-tent supervisory authority, as well as the criteria of relevance for the opinion in the individual case, cannot be conclusively assessed in advance.e)  Call risk and risk of the competent  supervisory authority preventing a call  (prolongation risk)CoCos are perpetual long-term debt securities that are callable by the issuer at certain call dates defined in the issue prospectus.",0.0
75,"The decision to call is made at the discretion of the issuer, but it does require the approval of the issuer™s compe-tent supervisory authority.",0.0
76,"The supervisory authority makes its decision in accordance with applicable regulatory law.The CoCo investor can only resell the CoCo in a secondary market, which is associated with corresponding market and liquidity risks.f)  Equity capital and subordination risk  (risk of a reversal of the capital structure)In the case of conversion to shares, CoCo inves-tors become shareholders when the trigger occurs.",0.0
77,"In the event of insolvency, claims of shareholders have subordinate priority and are dependent on the remaining funds available.",0.0
78,"Therefore, a conversion of the CoCo may lead to a total loss of capital.g)  Risk of concentration on a sectorDue to the special structure of CoCos, the risk of concentration on one sector may arise due to the uneven distribution of risks with regard to finan-cial securities.",0.0
79,"By law, CoCos are part of the capital structure of financial institutions.h)  Liquidity riskCoCos entail a liquidity risk in a tense market situation.",1.0
80,"This is due to the special investor base and the lower total market volume compared with that of normal bonds.i)  Income valuation riskDue to the fact that CoCos can be called on a flexible basis, it is not clear which date should be used for calculating the income.",0.0
81,"There is a risk on each call date that the maturity of the bond will be postponed and the income calculation must then be adjusted to the new date, which can lead to a different yield.j)  Unknown riskDue to the innovative nature of CoCos and the highly changeable regulatory environment for financial institutions, risks may arise that cannot be foreseen at the present time.For further information, please refer to the statement from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA/2014/944) dated July 31, 2014, regarding potential risks associated with investing in contingent convertible instruments.Liquidity riskLiquidity risks arise when a particular security is difficult to sell.",0.0
82,Only those securities are to be acquired for a sub-fund that can be resold at any time.,0.0
83,"However, difficulties may occur in selling individual securities in certain phases or in certain stock market segments at the desired time.",0.0
84,"In addition, there is a risk that securities traded in a rather narrow market segment will be subject to considerable price volatility.",0.0
85,Counterparty riskThe Investment Company may incur risks in the context of a contractual relationship with another party (a so-called ﬁcounterpartyﬂ).,0.0
86,Here there is a risk that the counterparty might no longer be able to meet its contractual obligations.,0.0
87,"These risks can affect the performance of the sub-fund, and can thus also adversely affect the net asset value per share and the capital invested by the investor.When OTC (over-the-counter) transactions are entered into, the respective sub-fund may be exposed to risks relating to the credit quality of its counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of such contracts.",0.0
88,"For example, the sub-fund may use futures, options and swap transac-tions or other derivative techniques, such as total return swaps, in which the sub-fund is subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligations under the respective contract.In the event of a counterparty™s bankruptcy or insolvency, a sub-fund may suffer significant losses due to a delay in liquidating positions, including the loss of value of the investments while a sub-fund enforces its rights.",0.0
89,"It is also possible that the use of the agreed techniques may be terminated through bankruptcy, illegality or changes in the law in comparison with those in force at the time of conclusion of the agreements.",0.0
90,"Sub-funds may, among other things, enter into transactions on OTC and interdealer markets.",0.0
91,The participants in these markets are typically not subject to financial supervision in the same way as the participants in regulated markets are.,0.0
92,"A sub-fund that invests in swaps, total return swaps, derivatives, synthetic instruments or other OTC transactions in these markets assumes the counterparty™s credit risk and is also subject to the counterparty™s default risk.",0.0
93,"These risks can be materially different from those of regulated market transactions, which are secured by guarantees, daily mark-to-market valuations, daily settlement and corresponding segregation and minimum capital requirements.",0.0
94,Transactions concluded directly between two counterparties do not benefit from this protection.,0.0
95,"A sub-fund is also subject to the risk that the counterparty will not execute the transaction as agreed, due to a discrepancy in the terms of the contract (irrespective of whether or not it is in good faith) or due to a credit or liquidity problem.",0.0
96,This may result in losses for the respective sub-fund.,0.0
97,"This counterparty risk increases for contracts with a longer maturity period, as events may prevent a settlement, or if a sub-fund has focused its transactions on a single counter-party or a small group of counterparties.",0.0
98,"If the counterparty defaults, a sub-fund may be subjected to opposing market movements during the execution of substitute transactions.",0.0
99,A sub-fund may conclude a transaction with any counterparty.,0.0
100,It can also conclude an unlimited number of transactions with a single counter-party.,0.0
101,"The ability of the sub-fund to conclude transactions with any counterparty, the lack of a meaningful and independent evaluation of the counterparty™s financial characteristics and the absence of a regulated market for concluding agreements can increase the sub-fund™s loss potential.Risks associated with the use  of securities lending  and repurchase agreementsIf the counterparty to a securities lending or repurchase agreement defaults, a sub-fund may suffer a loss in such a way that the proceeds from the sale of the securities held by the sub-fund in connection with the securities lending or repurchase agreement are less than the collat-eral provided.",0.0
102,"In addition, a sub-fund may also suffer losses as a result of bankruptcy or similar proceedings against the counterparty of the securities lending or repurchase agreement or any other type of non-performance of the return of the securities, e.g., loss of interest or loss of the respective securities, as well as default and enforcement costs in relation to the securities lending or repurchase agreement.",0.0
103,It is assumed that the use of acquisitions with repurchase options or a reverse repurchase agreement and securities lending agreement will not have a material impact on the performance of the 5sub-fund.,0.0
104,"However, the investment may have a significant effect, either positive or negative, on the net asset value of the sub-fund.Risks associated with the acceptance of collateralThe Investment Company receives collateral for derivative transactions, securities lending trans-actions and repurchase agreements.",0.0
105,"Derivatives, lent securities and securities sold under repur-chase agreements can increase in value.",0.0
106,"In that case, the collateral provided might no longer fully cover the Investment Company™s delivery or retransfer claim against the counterparty.The Investment Company can invest cash collat-eral in blocked cash accounts, in high-quality government bonds or in money market funds with short-term maturity structures.",0.0
107,"However, it is possible for the credit institution holding bank balances to default.",0.0
108,Government bonds and money market funds can perform negatively.,0.0
109,"When the transaction is ended, the collateral thus invested might no longer be fully available, even though collateral must be returned by the Investment Company in the amount originally granted.",0.0
110,"In that case, the Investment Company can be obligated to top up the collateral to the amount granted, thereby compensating for the loss incurred through the investment.Risks associated with the management of collateralThe management of this collateral requires the deployment of systems and the definition of certain processes.",0.0
111,"The failure of these processes as well as human or system failure at the Invest-ment Company or external third parties in con-nection with the management of collateral may result in the risk that the collateral could depreci-ate or no longer be sufficient to fully cover the Investment Company™s claim to delivery or re-transfer with respect to the counterparty.Investment policyThe respective sub-fund™s assets shall be invested in compliance with the principle of risk-spreading and within the general investment policy guidelines specified in the respective special section of the sales prospectus, and in accordance with the investment options and restrictions set out in article 2 of the general section of the sales prospectus.Performance benchmarkA sub-fund may use a financial index as a perfor-mance benchmark to compare performance, but will not attempt to replicate the composition of such an index.",0.0
112,"If a performance index is used for a sub-fund, further information can be found in the special section of the sales prospectus.",0.0
113,"When using a financial index as part of the investment strategy, the investment policy of the sub-fund will reflect this approach (see also the ﬁUse of financial indicesﬂ section of this sales prospectus).Techniques for efficient  portfolio managementPursuant to CSSF circular 14/592, the Investment Company may use techniques for efficient portfolio management.",0.0
114,"These include, among other things, all forms of derivative transactions, including total return swaps, as well as securities financing transactions, specifically securities lending and repurchase agreements.",0.0
115,"Transactions other than those mentioned here, such as mar-gin lending transactions, buy-sell-back and sell-buy-back transactions, are not currently being used.",0.0
116,"If the Management Company makes use of these securities financing transactions in the future, the sales prospectus will be amended accordingly.The use of total return swaps and securities financing transactions shall be in accordance with legal requirements, in particular Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 25, 2015, on the transparency of securities financing transactions and re-use and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (SFT Regulation).",0.0
117,"Use of derivativesSubject to an appropriate risk management system, the respective sub-fund may invest in any and all derivatives permitted under the Law of 2010 that are based on assets that may be acquired for the respective sub-fund or on finan-cial indices, interest rates, exchange rates or currencies.",0.0
118,"In particular, this includes options, financial futures and swaps (including total return swaps), as well as combinations thereof.",0.0
119,"These can be used not only for hedging but may also be part of the investment strategy.Trading in derivatives is conducted within the confines of the investment limits and provides for the efficient management of the sub-fund™s assets, while also regulating investment matur-ities and risks.",0.0
120,"SwapsThe Investment Company may conduct the following swap transactions for the account of the sub-funds within the scope of the invest-ment principles: Œinterest rate, Œcurrency, Œequity, Œtotal return or Œcredit default swaps.",0.0
121,Swap transactions are exchange contracts in which the parties swap the assets or risks underlying the respective transaction.,0.0
122,"Total return swapsA total return swap is a derivative in which one counterparty transfers to another counterparty the total return of a reference liability including income from interest and fees, gains and losses from price fluctuations, and credit losses.",0.0
123,"If a sub-fund makes use of the possibility of using total return swaps or other derivatives with com-parable characteristics in order to substantially implement the investment strategy, information on this, such as the underlying strategy or the counterparty, can be found in the special section of this sales prospectus and in the annual report.SwaptionsSwaptions are options on swaps.",0.0
124,"A swaption is the right, but not the obligation, to conduct a swap transaction, the terms of which are pre-cisely specified, at a certain point in time or within a certain period.Credit default swapsCredit default swaps are credit derivatives that enable the transfer of a volume of potential credit defaults to other parties.",0.0
125,"As compensation for accepting the credit default risk, the seller of the risk pays a premium to its counterparty.In all other aspects, the information for swaps applies accordingly.Securitized financial instrumentsThe Management Company may also acquire the financial instruments described in the preceding if they are securitized.",0.0
126,It is also possible for the transactions involving financial instruments to be only partly securitized (as in the case of war-rant-linked bonds).,0.0
127,"The statements on opportuni-ties and risks apply accordingly to such securitized financial instruments, but with the condition that the risk of loss in the case of securitized financial instruments is limited to the value of the security.OTC derivative transactionsThe Management Company may conduct both those derivative transactions admitted for trading on an exchange or included in another organized market and over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.",0.0
128,This organized market meets the criteria of article 50 of the UCITS Directive.,0.0
